Arm TrustZone CryptoCell cryptographic accelerators

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,cc7x".
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: Should contain the single interrupt specifier.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: should designate the interrupt controller the device
  is routed to, unless the property is inherited.
- clocks: the clock used by the core.
- power-domains: Must contain a reference to the PM domain.


Example:

	arm_cc7x: arm_cc7x@80000000 {
		compatible = "arm,cc7x";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = < 0 30 4 >;
		reg = < 0x80000000 0x10000 >;
	};
